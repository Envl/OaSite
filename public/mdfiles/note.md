### What worked and what didn't

Almost all tasks worked. The biggest obstacle is that we can not use _rotate,_ which makes the creation of triangles in different direction a pain. As making triangles in 4 dimension with gigantic circle requires a lot work on maintaining overlapping relation. To save time I've chosen smaller circles to make triangles at the right side.

### Properties used as tools

- Shape.
  ![big_demon_idle_anim_f3.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/27/4G8xSjLXlTtBvuq.png)
  I've used rectangle's edge as ruler to align items.

  I've used giant circle's edge as "straight" line to make triangles.

- Dimension

  Rectangle was also copy and pasted several times to ensure distance between red rectangles are even.

## Steps I needed to make this poster

1. Create a `big blue rect` to be the background
2. Create a `big red rect`, which is slightly smaller than the blue one
3. Create a slim `verticle stripe` using rect, and a `horizontal one` as well.
4. Create a small `white square` as the prototype of all little squares.
5. Use that white square as the "gap" to duplicate these stripes to make all these `small red squares`

6. Use `big blue rects` to cover redundant small red squares and put `text` on it

7. Use `giant blue circle's edge` as a straight line to make triangles ( this is the moment bad thing happens

8. As I can not use CROP, I have to duplicate some `small red squares from scratch` by creating 1 small red square and duplicate it to 2 4 8 16, then I use them to make up the lost squares.(In this process, I used the formerly mentioned stripes as "gap"
9. I can not use giant circles to make triangles at the right side as they would cover all red squares at the left side. So I made trange `triangles` by putting small blue circles on small red square. Then copy some small red squares to cover incomplete squares

10. Put blue circle on top of same sized red circle to make a half `logo`, then duplicate it to make the full logo.
11. Add text under the logo and used a stripe to help me align them with the edge of the "F".
